national park service checker
====================

Just a basic script written to find out what time the National Park Service website starts accepting lottery applications for hiking permits each day.

Of course after I wrote it, I found out there's no limit to the number of lottery applications.. :(

now checks the website for lottery number changes.  lottery.log provides sample output.
